        <h3 class="archery">Archery:</h3>
        <p>Although I just started doing archery, it's something that I really enjoy doing. It connects me with nature and challenges my focus and precision. As of right now
            I haven't started competing but I do enjoy practicing in the backyard and shooting at targets and cans. The thrill of hitting the bullseye or hearing the crinkle
            of the can is always rewarding.

            gaming allows me to immerse myself in captivating stories and experiences.
